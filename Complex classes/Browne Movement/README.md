### Brownian motion of particles interacting according to Coulomb's law

1. The Brownian motion of particles in discrete space is realized
2. At startup, when the visualization of particle motion appears, the cells of the field are colored in different colors depending on the number of particles in this cell
3. Particles attract according to Coulomb's law. If the charge of the particles is made too large, all the particles will stick together at one point
